# lodgit_availability_ics_merge
This project periodically grabs the availability ics calender files from the lodgit server and merges definable pools of them to one ics file that represents the availability of one room a defined pool in a binary manner, like the original files do. The files new files may then be offered to services like airbnb to import them via link to automaticly set availablity in their calendar.
